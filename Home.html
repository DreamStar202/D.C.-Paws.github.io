<h2> About:</h2>
<h3><p> Approximately 6.5 million animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats. The number of dogs and cats entering U.S. shelters annually has declined, from approximately 2.6 million in 2011.  This decline can be partially explained by an increase in the percentage of animals adopted and an increase in the number of stray animals successfully returned to their owners. Approximately 3.2 million shelter animals are adopted each year. Our mission is to provide each loving animal a second chance at life. We hope each animals will be assigned a permanent  home, in which they can be surrounded by never-ending love. Adopt now, become the one who makes a change for a fortunate animal. Change starts with you!

<p><div><h2> Our Mission:</h2></div>
The D.C Paws mission is to ensure that every uniquely-beautiful animal located in Washington, D.C shelters will be assigned a permanent place to call home; ensuring that each and every animal are assigned to the perfect family. We hope that our website will provide the best information to where you can  adopt your dream pet,  the easiest process into adopting your pet and more.
</p>
<p><div><h2>Who Are We:</h2></div>
We are a group of highschool girls hoping to change the statistics of animals being adopted in the D.C shelters each year.
</p>
<p>
<div><h2>Why Does This Matter:</h2></div>
Adopting an animal is significant because it grants each animal  a second chance at life. Shelters allow animals to be rescued from harsh environments but will only provide a temporary home for them. However, these animals are in need of a permanent home. We believe that each animal in these D.C shelters should be assigned to a loving home. Be the hero and save another life today.
