  <div><h2>Meet Blaine</h2></div>
This poor little guy was rescued injured, but now is ready to find a loving home. Blaine is just a year old and as sweet and handsome as a Tabby can be. He's a little shy, but is enjoying the attention he is getting now that he's safe and well. In fact, he will give you some gentle head butts and purr to prove it. And, should you give him a treat or two, hell be one happy young fellow, but hell be even happier if you take him home.

  <div><h2> Meet Coco Rico</h2></div>
Mr. Coco Rico is a friendly low-key gentleman who likes attention and will politely ask for it. He was rescued by some kind folks and is all dressed up in his tuxedo, ready to celebrate finding a real home to call his own. Coco Rico is a mature fellow who would probably be happiest in an adult home. As an added bonus, if you're over 50, his adoption fee is waived as part of the Boomer's Buddies program! Standard adoption procedures apply. To meet Coco Rico, email his foster at

<div><h2> Meet Treasure</h2></div>
  It's no accident that Im named Treasure, because I am one. I'm a big and beautiful Tabby who is looking for a new home where I can curl up in a warm corner and spend my golden years. I like head scratches and chin rubs and might even ask you for some with a few gentle head butts. In short, I'd be a mellow and sweet companion. And, as an added bonus, if you're over 50, my adoption fee is waived as part of the Boomers Buddies program! Standard adoption procedures apply.

<div><h2>Meet Farrow</h2></div>
Looking for a little magic, to put some spark into your life? Look no further Farrow the wizard is here to make all your dreams come true. I am looking for a home where I can be the only canine magician. I may have short legs but I love going running with my friends here at HRA. I also love showing off what magic tricks I have begun to learn such as sit, as long as you offer me some yummy treats. I love to strike up a conversation with every new person I meet, if you are looking for a companion to talk to I am the pup for you! If I sound like the right dog for you, run to HRA and check me out!

<div><h2> Meet Cobain</h2></div>
  Hi, Im Cobain and Im a bundle of energy who would love to meet you! A few facts about me: I'm nervous about getting in and out of cars and would love your help to be more confident. I accept treats beautifully and am very happy when you feed me, but please give me lots of opportunities to go to the bathroom or I might go inside by accident! I love to play and may use my teeth but will stop as soon as you tell me to. I am very curious and want to explore everything inside and out. Will you teach me and give me a forever home?

<div><h2>Meet Iggy</h2></div>
  Hi! My name is Iggy and I ALWAYS have the biggest smile on my face! I love giving kisses and cuddles. Play time is my favorite time. I'm not a fan of cats or small animals, unfortunately. I am completely house trained and can stay home alone for an extended period of time. Email my foster mom at <a href= "mailto:nnicholas@humanerescuealliance.org?subject=Website%20contact"/change-hyperlink-color.php style="color:blue">nnicholas@humanerescuealliance.org</a> if you want a short, stocky friend like me for life!

<div><h2>Meet Marilyn</h2></div>
You might think that I'm just a sweet young thing, and I am sweet and young, but I've already been a Mama. Now that my kittens are safe and sound and old enough to get along without me, I really want a wonderful home to call my own. I'm a calm and kindly little lady who would be a wonderful companion and friend for many years to come. How about spending those years together? Please come to meet me and let me show you what a great idea that would be.
</p>

<div><h2>Meet Winter</h2></div>
Hiya, I'm Winter, and the name suits my pretty white coat! I am house-trained and crate-trained and know some tricks! I've got a sweet face and a wiggly bottom when I meet nice new people, and I love to show off my skills for treats! Even though I can be wiggly and a little jumpy with adults, I'm nice and calm with kids because I know they're small, but I need to be your only pet. I'm also a really fast learner and eager to please, so I'm sure we'll get along just great! As an added bonus, if you're over 50, my adoption fee is waived as part of the Boomer's Buddies program! Standard adoption procedures apply.

  <div><h2>Meet Cindy</h2></div>
  I might look all dog from the outside but on the inside, Im part lapdog, part pig (I have a really cute snort every once in a while), and part couch potato. I enjoy a good run around the park but really, I just want to snuggle and get pets and hang out with you. Im super sweet and would love to cuddle up with my new forever family.
